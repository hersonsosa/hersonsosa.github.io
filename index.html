        <p class="section__subtitle section__subtitle--about">Software developer | Marine Corps Veteran | Musician</p>

        <div class="about me-body">
            <p>Growing up in Northern Virginia allowed for an extremely diverse childhood made up of some amazing experiences. I was lucky enough to have big military contract companies such as Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman come to my Middle School
                and High School to teach me robotics and engineering. This sparked an idea that I would pursue for the next many years.</p>
            <p>In my spare time, I have always escaped to music. I grew up in a religious household and was quickly introduced to all sorts of instruments. I became an expert driven by the idea that "practice makes perfect". I even got to play Elvis's piano.
                It was this same idea that pushed me to become a US Marine.
            </p>
            <p>"The few, the proud." I was very proud to detonate ordnance, to fly drones and to run many, many miles. And after many travels around the world and once-in-a-lifetime experiences, my contract in the military came to an end. Suddenly, I'm in
                Ohio, where I continued with my goal to become involved in future technology. Unbeknownst to me, programming was something I had already experienced.</p>
            <p>With the inclusion of HTML back in the days of MySpace, office sites such as SharePoint, programming and development were something I was already involved in. This led to self-learning, using any means available. Just when I thought my resources
                were exhausted I found WCCI. With their training and guidance, I hope to be a successful Web Developer.</p>

        <p class="wcci-title">As a current student at WeCanCodeIt, I have been taught the necessary skills and the methods of application for my projects and future as a developer. Here are some examples of what I have learned so far. Please visit their site for more information.</p>

                <h3>Java</h3>
                <p>Java is an object-oriented programming language that produces software for multiple platforms. When a programmer writes a Java application, the compiled code runs on most operating systems, including Windows, Linux and Mac OS. Java is
                    an object-oriented language, which means all programs are made of entities representing concepts or physical things known as “objects”.</p>

                <h3>HTML</h3>
                <p>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the code that is used to structure a web page and its content. For example, content could be structured within a set of paragraphs, a list of bulleted points, or using images and data tables. HTML consists
                    of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a certain way, or act a certain way.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="skill">
                <h3>CSS</h3>
                <p>Stands for "Cascading Style Sheet." Cascading style sheets are used to format the layout of Web pages. They can be used to define text styles, table sizes, and other aspects of Web pages that previously could only be defined in a page's
                    HTML. CSS helps Web developers create a uniform look across several pages of a Web site. CSS makes it easy to change styles across several pages at once.
